## Ansible Playbook: 

Playbooks are YAML files that define a set of tasks to be executed in sequence on one or more managed nodes. Ansible playbooks are saved as file `.yaml` or `yml`.


_This playbook contains the following elements:_

| Element                | Purpose                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `---`                  | Indicates the **start** of a YAML document (playbook).                                                     |
| `name`                 | A **human-readable description** of the play or playbook. Appears in Ansible's output when the play runs.  |
| `hosts`                | Defines which **inventory group or host(s)** to target (e.g., `all`, `webservers`).                        |
| `become: yes`          | Runs the tasks with **elevated privileges** (like `sudo`).                                                 |
| `become_user: root`    | Specifies the **user to become**, similar to running `sudo su - root`. Default is `root` if not specified. |
| `vars`                 | Declares **variables** used in the playbook. In this example, `greeting = Hello World!`.                   |
| `tasks`                | A list of **instructions** that will be executed on the remote host(s).                                    |
| `...`                  | (Optional) Denotes the **end** of the YAML file, though it's rarely used in real-world playbooks.          |



### Playbook Structure:

```
---
- name: <Name of the play>
  hosts: <Target group from inventory>
  become: <true/false - run as sudo?>
  vars:               # Optional variables
    key: value

  tasks:              # Main section
    - name: <Task description>
      <module_name>:    # Example: yum/dnf, copy, service
        option1: value
        option2: value
```


#### Task Structure: 
_Each task typically includes:_

- `name`: A description of the task.
- `module_name`: The Ansible module to use (yum/dnf, copy, service, etc.).
- `arguments`: Options for the module.


```
- name: <Description of the task>         # Required for readability (not execution)
  module_name:                            # Example: yum/dnf, copy, service
    option1: value                        # Module-specific options
    option2: value
```



### Example: Simple Playbook: 

```
- name: Install Apache and start service
  hosts: node1
  become: yes   # use for 'sudo'
  vars:
    http_port: 80  # Define a variable
  tasks:
    - name: Install httpd package
      dnf:
        name: httpd
        state: present

    - name: Start and enable service
      service:
        name: httpd
        state: started
        enabled: true
```


_Syntax check of the playbook:_
```
ansible-playbook httpd-install.yaml --syntax-check 
```


_To perform a dry-run of the playbook:_
```
ansible-playbook httpd-install.yaml --check
```


_To run playbook:_
```
ansible-playbook httpd-install.yaml
```


### Ansible `gather_facts`:

In Ansible, ‚ÄúGathering Facts‚Äù refers to the process of collecting detailed information (facts) about the remote target systems before running tasks.


#### What Are ‚ÄúFacts‚Äù?

_Facts are system-level variables automatically collected by Ansible, such as:_

| Fact Name                      | Example Value  | Description             |
| ------------------------------ | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| `ansible_hostname`             | `web01`        | Hostname of the machine |
| `ansible_os_family`            | `RedHat`       | OS family               |
| `ansible_distribution`         | `Rocky`        | Linux distribution name |
| `ansible_default_ipv4.address` | `192.168.1.10` | Default IP address      |
| `ansible_processor_cores`      | `4`            | Number of CPU cores     |


#### When to Use or Skip It
‚úÖ Use when: 
- You want to use system facts in your playbook (e.g., detect OS, RAM, IP).

üö´ Skip when:
- You don‚Äôt need facts (faster playbook execution).
- You're working on a system where setup module might fail (e.g., restricted devices).


#### Example: 

```
---
- name: Gather facts demo
  hosts: node1
  become: yes
  gather_facts: true  # default is 'true'

  tasks:
    - name: Print facts
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        var: ansible_facts
        #msg: "This host is running {{ ansible_distribution }}"

#### Add a line if it doesn't exist:

```





#### Uncomment and update a config line:


1. Playbook: SSH Port Change: 

- `regexp: '^#?Port\s+'` ‚Äî This matches both `Port` and `#Port`.

- `backup: yes` ‚Äî Makes a backup of the original file before editing.


```
---
- name: Update SSH Configuration
  hosts: node1
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Change SSH Port to 2222
      lineinfile:

        regexp: '^#?Port\s+'
        line: 'Port 2222'
        state: present

    - name: Restart SSH service
      service:
        name: sshd
        state: restarted
```



2. Playbook: PostgreSQL listening on '*': 

This replaces `#listen_addresses = 'localhost'` or `listen_addresses = 'localhost'` with `listen_addresses = '*'`.

```
---
- name: Update PostgreSQL Configuration
  hosts: node1
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Ensure PostgreSQL listening on '*'
      lineinfile:
        path: /var/lib/pgsql/16/data/postgresql.conf
        regexp: '^#?listen_addresses\s*='
        line: "listen_addresses = '*'"

        backup: yes

    - name: Restart PostgreSQL service
      service:
        name: postgresql-16
        state: restarted
```



### Ansible loop: 

The `loop` keyword allows you to **run a task multiple times**, once for each item in a list. It's a replacement for the older `with_items` syntax and is more readable and flexible.


- `item` is the **default variable name** in Ansible's `loop`. So, item is not mandatory, but it is the default 
- `{{ item }}` :	Jinja2 syntax to interpolate the loop variable in the task.
- It executes the task once with `item` substituted into the `path` or `name` field.

### `shell` Modules Playbook:  

In Ansible (and YAML in general), `|` and `>` are used to define **multi-line strings**, but they behave differently:


#### Run multiple `shell` commands:

- Use `|` to write multiple lines under `shell`.
- Commands run in order, as a single shell script.
- Use `args: executable: /bin/bash` to specify bash shell (optional but common).


```

- name: Run multiple shell commands example
  hosts: node1
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Run multiple commands in one shell task
      shell: |
        echo "Starting updates..."
        yum update -y
        echo "Cleaning cache..."
        yum clean all
        echo "Done!"
      args:
        executable: /bin/bash
```



#### `|` (Literal Block Scalar):

- **Preserves line breaks exactly as written**.
- Each new line in YAML becomes a **real new line** in the string.

```
shell: |
  echo "Start"
  echo "Next line"
```


This results in:
```
echo "Start"
echo "Next line"
```



#### `>` (Folded Block Scalar): 

- **Joins all lines into a single line**, replacing newlines with `spaces` unless you add `\n`.
- Useful when writing a **long command split** over lines in YAML.

```
shell: >
  echo "Start"
  echo "Next line"
```


This results in:
```
echo "Start" echo "Next line"
```


#### Example:

That‚Äôs the correct use ‚Äî > is **joining the full command into one line** while allowing YAML readability.

```
shell: >
  mysql --connect-expired-password -uroot -p'{{ mysql_temp_pass.stdout }}'
  -e "ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '{{ mysql_root_password }}';"
```


Which becomes:
```
mysql --connect-expired-password -uroot -p'...password...' -e "ALTER USER ...;"
```









An Ansible Playbook is a simple yet powerful tool to automate IT tasks such as software installation, configuration management, service control, user management, and more.
